This project is a real-time vital sign monitoring device powered by the Internet of Things. It combines a temperature sensor and a pulse sensor with Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling real-time data transfer to a web or mobile application. The project, which focuses on demonstrating IoT in healthcare monitoring, has been classified as "no problem related," meaning it is mainly exploratory and educational in nature. The project is still under development and improvement; it remains a work in progress.
